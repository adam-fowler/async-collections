# AsyncCollections

Functions for running async processes on Swift Collections

## ForEach

Run an async function on every element of a Sequence.
```swift
await array.asyncForEach {
    await asyncProcess($0)
}
```
The async closures are run serially ie the closure run on the current element of a sequence has to finish before we run the closure on the next element.

To run the closures concurrently use
```swift
try await array.concurrentForEach {
    try await asyncProcess($0)
}
```
You can manage the number of tasks running at any one time with the `maxConcurrentTasks` parameter
```swift
try await array.concurrentForEach(maxConcurrentTasks: 4) {
    try await asyncProcess($0)
}
```

## Map

Return an array transformed by an async function.
```swift
let result = await array.asyncMap {
    return await asyncTransform($0)
}
```

Similar to `asyncForEach` there are versions of `asyncMap` that runs the transforms concurrently.

```swift
let result = await array.concurrentMap(maxConcurrentTasks: 8) {
    return await asyncTransform($0)
}
```

## Compact Map

Return a non-optional array transformed by an async function returning optional results.
```swift
let result: [MyType] = await array.asyncCompactMap { value -> MyType? in
    return await asyncTransform(value)
}
```

Similar to `asyncForEach` there are versions of `asyncCompactMap` that runs the transforms concurrently.

```swift
let result: [MyType] = await array.concurrentCompactMap(maxConcurrentTasks: 8) { value -> MyType? in
    return await asyncTransform(value)
```

## FlatMap

Return a concatenated array transformed by an async function that returns a sequence.
```swift
let result: [MySequence.Element] = await array.asyncMap { value -> MySequence in
    return await asyncTransform($0)
}
```

Similar to `asyncForEach` there are versions of `asyncFlatMap` that runs the transforms concurrently.

```swift
let result: [MySequence.Element] = await array.concurrentMap(maxConcurrentTasks: 8) { value -> MySequence in
    return await asyncTransform($0)
}
```

## Filter

Return a filtered array transformed by an async function.
```swift
let result = await array.asyncFilter {
    return await asyncTransform($0)
}
```

Similar to `asyncForEach` there are versions of `asyncFilter` that runs the transforms concurrently.

```swift
let result = await array.concurrentFilter(maxConcurrentTasks: 8) {
    return await asyncTransform($0)
}
```
